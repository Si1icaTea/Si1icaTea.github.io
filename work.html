                    <p>Created in the early 2020's, Zyramede Interactive aims to lead the way in hybridization of computers, humans, and media. Join us as we embark on this exciting journey into the unknown.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>If you think you have a project that would benefit from colaborating with Zyramede Interactive, feel free to reach out. Our fees work on a sliding scale, with more interesting projects and the financial situation of the artist taken into account.</p>
